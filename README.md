# vim-config

This repository contain configuration of individual vim plugins. It is intended
for a userbase of exactly one person, myself. As such I do not take any special
consideration that another potential user might already be using the defined
hotkeys, etc. Feel free to use if you are so inclined.

## Install using vimplug

    Plug 'metheon/vim-config'
